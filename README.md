## Purpose

The goal of this project is to promote greater community involvement and
volunteerism in regional parks. In todayâ€™s economic climate, environmental
concerns often receive less attention, making it harder to support and protect
our natural spaces. Unfortunately, the current
[ocparks.com/events](https://ocparks.com/events) page is difficult to navigate,
which may discourage participation. This project aims to simplify access to
event information through a more user-friendly website, making it easier for
people to engage and give back to their local community.

If you are interested, but afraid to partake in any of these events, I want to
provide an easy outlet for others to engage in helping out.

## Features

- Developed with the **Deno** runtime and the **Fresh** web framework for fast,
  server-rendered pages
- Utilizes **DenoKV** to store and cache scraped OC Parks event data
- Integrates a
  [**Scikit-learn** machine learning model](https://github.com/k4rni/events-tagger)
  to automatically generate relevant event tags
- ML model is deployed as a standalone microservice using **Render**
- Includes a filterable UI that lets users browse events by machine-generated
  tags
- Features a responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
